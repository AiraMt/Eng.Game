# What is the game about?
This game is about memory. A color is flashed at a certain speed depending on the level the player is on, and the player cycles through the given colors to pick the correct color that was flashed. 

# Rules of the game:
Once the code begins, it will display a color pattern and instructions. When the introduction are done, a color will flash. Speeds will vary, increasing with each level. After the flash, the board will display solid colors that can be cycled through by pressing the left and right buttons. The left button will increase the color value, and the right will decrease the color. The player will increase or decreases the color value to find the color that flashed, the player will flip the switch to submit the color value, and the program will state if the choice was correct or incorrect. If the choice is incorrect, lights flash, and the player will be set back to level one. If the player is correct, the player will move up a level.
